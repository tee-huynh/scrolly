        conditions are requirements that a company must complete to be allowed to construct, operate and abandon a project. a large portion of the NEB&#39;s compliance work focuses on overseeing companies to make sure they comply with the conditions the NEB has set.

        <div class="title"><b style="color: #ff4c5e">when</b> is a company required to meet its conditions?</div>
        condition timelines are project-specific. the NEB can impose conditions throughout the life cycle of the project. sometimes, companies must meet conditions before they can begin a new project or a new phase of a project.

        <div class="title">Ramping Back Up</div>
        Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.

        <div class="title">The Cough Effect</div>
        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.

        The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.
